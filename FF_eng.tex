\ecvitem[5pt]{Main Academic Projects}{
\begin{itemize}
	\setlength\itemsep{1pt}
	\item[\color{curious-blue}\tiny$\blacksquare$] Master Thesis subject: computing the Gibbs measure of the subgraphs-world dynamics for the Ising model on real world big datasets.
	\item[\color{curious-blue}\tiny$\blacksquare$] I developed a Python tool, with a colleague and a research assistant, able to output a car driver's condition, by computing the Arousal level using a hypo-vigilance driver.
	\item[\color{curious-blue}\tiny$\blacksquare$] I wrote a survey for the class of “Networks security” about Smart Grids and their security.
	\item[\color{curious-blue}\tiny$\blacksquare$] For the class “Structures of the social networks”, I implemented and applied centrality measures and one diffusion model to a real-world sample, in order to evaluate the influence of the most important nodes.
	\item[\color{curious-blue}\tiny$\blacksquare$] During the class of “Robotics”, together with two colleagues, I built a gesture controlled vehicle using the Intel Galileo board as controller and the C++ language.
	\item[\color{curious-blue}\tiny$\blacksquare$] In a three member team, for the class “Data integration on web”, I developed an NBA players and teams data statistics web application, by gathering and integrating them from several websites using Node.js, Express and Angular.js.
	\item[\color{curious-blue}\tiny$\blacksquare$] During the class “Programming languages and compilers”, in a team, I developed the lexical, syntactic and semantic analysis modules for a compiler for the didactic language COOL.
	\item[\color{curious-blue}\tiny$\blacksquare$] I developed a scalable application, in a six members team, for the class “Advanced operating system”, based on MapReduce paradigm and the framework Apache Hadoop2, for the sequence alignment of genomics and proteomics. Also with some of them, I configured and maintained the forty nodes Hadoop cluster .
	\item[\color{curious-blue}\tiny$\blacksquare$] For the class “Computer networks II”, in a three members team, I contributed to a Firefox extension called NoTrace by developing a graphic visualization of lost information while browsing, using the libraries Sigma.js and Twitter Bootstrap.
	\item[\color{curious-blue}\tiny$\blacksquare$] Bachelor Thesis subject: I integrated, with another graduating colleague, the MASON library in a visual design system for agent-based simulations called Agent Modeling Platform, with automated generation of Java code, based on Eclipse, Java, Xpand, Xtend, EMF and PDT.
%	\item[\color{curious-blue}\tiny$\blacksquare$] I developed a web application focused on the books sharing, along with two colleagues for the class "Software engineering". Such application is designed using PHP, MySQL, HTML5, CSS3 and Javascript.
	\item[\color{curious-blue}\tiny$\blacksquare$] In the last years, I studied the Node.js platform and its most relevant modules. I published five modules on \url{http://npmjs.org}. The development was versioned by git, hosting the code on GitHub. I studied the open source licenses and learned its deploy process.
