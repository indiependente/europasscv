\ecvsection{Additional Information}

\ecvitem[5pt]{Main Academic Projects}{
{
\begin{itemize}
	\item[\color{curious-blue}\tiny$\blacksquare$] Master Thesis subject: computing the Gibbs measure of the subgraphs-world dynamics for the Ising model on real world big datasets.
	\item[\color{curious-blue}\tiny$\blacksquare$] I developed a tool in collaboration with a colleague and a research assistant. The tool is written in Python and is able of determining the driver condition/performance, by computing the Arousal level through a driver hypo-vigilance.
	\item[\color{curious-blue}\tiny$\blacksquare$] I realized for the class of “Networks security” a survey with three colleagues about Smart Grids and their security.
	\item[\color{curious-blue}\tiny$\blacksquare$] For the class “Structures of the social networks”, I implemented and applied centrality measures and one diffusion model to a real sample, in order to evaluate the influence of the most important nodes.
	\item[\color{curious-blue}\tiny$\blacksquare$] During the class of “Robotics”, together with two colleagues, I builded a vehicle controlled by gesture using as controller the Intel Galileo board and C++ as programming language.
	\item[\color{curious-blue}\tiny$\blacksquare$] Along with three other colleagues for the class “Data integration on web”, I developed a web application for viewing all the details related to the National Basket Association, by gathering from several websites and integrating them through Node.js, Express and Angular.js.
	\item[\color{curious-blue}\tiny$\blacksquare$] During the class “Programming languages and compilers”, I developed compiler for the didactic language COOL, exactly the modules for the lexical, syntactic and semantic analysis, along with several colleguaes.
	\item[\color{curious-blue}\tiny$\blacksquare$] I realized a scalable application, together with other five colleagues for the class “Advanced operating system”, based on MapReduce paradigm and the framework Apache
	Hadoop2, for the sequences alignment of genomics and proteomics. Also with some of them, I configured and handled the Hadoop cluster consisting of forty computers.
	\item[\color{curious-blue}\tiny$\blacksquare$] For the class “Computer networks II” together with other two colleagues, I contributed to a Firefox extention called NoTrace by developing a graphic visualization of lost information while browsing, through the libraries Sigma.js and Twitter Bootstrap.
	\item[\color{curious-blue}\tiny$\blacksquare$] For my bachelor’s degree thesis with another graduating colleague, I realized the integration
	of the library MASON in the Agent Modeling Platform, which is a visual design system for agent-based simulations with automated generation of Java code, based on Eclipse and its plug-in. The entire project is realized in Java, Xpand, Xtend, EMF and PDT.
	\item[\color{curious-blue}\tiny$\blacksquare$] I developed a web application focused on the books sharing, along with two colleagues for the class "Software engineering". Such application is designed using PHP, MySQL, HTML5, CSS3 and Javascript.
	\item[\color{curious-blue}\tiny$\blacksquare$] In the last year, I studied the Node.js platform and its most relevant modules. I created and published five modules on npmjs.org. The development was versioned by git, hosting the code on GitHub. The publication implied the understanding of open source various kind of licences and the Node.js modules deploy mechanism.
